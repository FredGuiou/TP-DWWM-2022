# TP-DWWM-2022

Here it's ! During August to October 2022, I prepared the Web &amp; Mobile Web Développer degree Level V.

As a reminder, I arrived in training without any particular knowledge in web development. I am happy to be able to present my work to you and proud of the progress made. This is just the beginning.

You can find all of my work in 3 pdf files ! 💪🏼  

- First : The professional file
It contains the six skills divided into two activities (front/back) required by the ministry's reference system.

- Second : The Project file
It is a question here of presenting in minimum 48750 characters one or more personal projects falling within the fields of the required skills.

- Third : The slides
This is a synthetic pdf file of the project file allowing the jury to present the work accomplished orally.

Enjoy and good reanding ! 🚀
